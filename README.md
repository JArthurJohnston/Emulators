# Emulators

A collection of emulators written in java. I started writing this in an attempt to
better understand assembly level programming without actually writing any assembly :)

Im currently working on a Chip 8 emulator. after thats done Ill move onto the Gameboy.
Then who knows. maybe one day Ill write a PSX emulator!
