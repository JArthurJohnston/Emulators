/**
 * Dxyn - DRW Vx, Vy, nibble
 * Display n-byte sprite starting at memory location I at (Vx, Vy), set VF = collision.
 *
 * The interpreter reads n bytes from memory, starting at the address stored in I.
 * These bytes are then displayed as sprites on screen at coordinates (Vx, Vy).
 * Sprites are XORed onto the existing screen. If this causes any pixels to be erased,
 * VF is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0.
 * If the sprite is positioned so part of it is outside the coordinates of the display,
 * it wraps around to the opposite side of the screen. See instruction 8xy3 for more information on XOR,
 * and section 2.4, Display, for more information on the Chip-8 screen and sprites.
